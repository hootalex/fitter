# Fitter Happier (The Game)

A weird game where you type the lyrics to "Fitter Happier" by Radiohead as the song is playing, and you get a score based on how fast you can type sort of. http://hootalex.github.io/fitterhappier/

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance uses this to calculate score.
 * Reverse-engineered from http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/levenshtein/
* Don't worry about punctuation, also it's number "3" days a week.
* Almost impossible and very miserable to play
